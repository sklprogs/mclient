- Fix hang-up after canceling saving article.
- Minimize the window using MMB (bind_close_top) when not in the Clipboard Mode
- (Optionally) Hide the History field after copying items in it or following them (AutoHideHistory)
- Rely on URL instead of string requests in the History
- Add a ShortHistory key: add requests that already have been added to the History (0, False) or not (1, True).  Set ShortHistory=0 to make navigation with buttons '→' and '←' more consistent.

# mclient
A Multitran Online Client (MClient) is a program that connects to the web-site multitran.com and returns translation of words entered by a user. Stardict, Lingvo DSL and Multitran (Demo) formats are supported by internal plugins. The objective of this program is to ensure an instant access to translations and also to provide some additional functionality like sorting by various criteria, blocking/prioritizing sibjects, etc. Dictionary entries are formatted in columns. Please see 'docs' for the full manual.

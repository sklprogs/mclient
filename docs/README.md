The Multitran Online Client (MClient) is a program that connects to the 
[multitran.com](https://www.multitran.com/) web-site and returns translation of
words entered by the user. Stardict, Lingvo DSL and Multitran (Demo) formats
are supported by internal plugins.

The objective of this program is to ensure instant access to translations and
also to provide some additional functionality like sorting by various criteria,
blocking\/prioritizing sibjects, etc. Dictionary entries are formatted in
columns. Please see [docs](https://github.com/sklprogs/mclient/tree/main/docs)
for the full manual.

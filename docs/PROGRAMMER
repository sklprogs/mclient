- In order to make a web-page to have columns without too wide gaps:
  1) Do not set zero-length fixed columns (if they are present, 
     the layout will be broken even in modern browsers). Alternatively,
     set them to have a very small width, e.g., 0.1%-1% (0% does not
     work).
  2) a) Set the table to be as wide as fixed and term columns in total,
        e.g., '<table style="width: 45%">', or
     b) Do not explicitly set a table width. Instead, create a wide
        empty column as follows:
            <td/>
            <td style="width: 55%"/>
        For some reason, an empty column must be created before
        the empty column with the fixed width, otherwise, the last term
        column will appear at the right corner.
- Blocks like "Английский тезаурус" and "Русский тезаурус" are skipped
  since setting several blocks of the same fixed type in succession is
  not supported for now
- Multitran does not escape '<' and '>' in user terms/comments properly
- BLOCK field is used to skip server contents; IGNORE field is used for
  internal purposes to skip unknown/invalid block types
- Inserting the last search string sometimes does not work; looks like
  a Linux-specific bug

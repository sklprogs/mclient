- Blocks like "Английский тезаурус" and "Русский тезаурус" are skipped
  since setting several blocks of the same fixed type in succession is
  not supported for now
- Multitran does not escape '<' and '>' in user terms/comments properly
- BLOCK field is used to skip server contents; IGNORE field is used for
  internal purposes to skip unknown/invalid block types
- Inserting the last search string sometimes does not work; looks like
  a Linux-specific bug
